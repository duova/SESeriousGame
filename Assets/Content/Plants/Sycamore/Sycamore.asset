  description: 'A member of the maple family, sycamore trees are recognisable by
    their distinctive helicopter seeds. Growing up to 35 meters tall, board and with
    dense foliage, they can be found in parkland, hedgerows and woodlands throughout
    the United Kingdom. '

    text: "Sycamore leaves have five pointed lobes arranged like a spread out hand.
      This shape is called palmate, and is a common feature of leaves in the maple
      family. They are quite large, measuring 7-16 cm. Notice the toothed margins
      \u2013 these are specific to sycamores."

    text: "One of the most identifiable features of the sycamore is its winged \u201Chelicopter\u201D
      seeds, called samaras. Forming in pairs, when you through them up, they spin
      around and spiral slowly to the ground. Try it! In the spring, get up close
      to the tree and look at the leaf stalks. It may surprise you to find that they
      are a distinctive red colour. "

    text: "Find a sycamore leaf and you may notice \u2018tar\u2019 spots on it. These
      are common and are caused by a type of fungus. Turn the leaf over, and you
      will find that the leaf veins are hairy. Sycamores also produce flowers. They
      are small and yellow-green, and hang in spikes called \u201Cracemes\u201D. "

    text: Have a look at the bark of the sycamore tree. It has a dark pinky grey
      hue when young. Over time, flat plates of bark will fall off to reveal orangy
      brown bark below. The twigs are pinky-brown!
