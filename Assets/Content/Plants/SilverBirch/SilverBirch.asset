  description: 'Silver Birch trees are easily identified by their striking white
    bark. Growing up to 30 meters tall, they have elegant drooping branches. '
  journalEntries:
  - stage: 1
    text: 'Although most recognizable by their bark, you can also identify Silver
      Birches from their triangular shaped leaves. These have pointed tips and serrated
      edges. '

    text: "Silver Birch leaves are light green in colour. The white bark sheds like
      tissue paper. You can also notice dark, diamond shaped fissures in the bark
      as the tree matures.\r"

    text: 'The Silver Birch Tree produces both male and female catkins. Male catkins
      are yellow, and hang in groups of 2 or 4. They are typically 4-5cm long. '
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
  - stage: 4
    text: 'Female catkins are shorter than the male catkins and stand up right. They
      are bright green and can often be found around from March through to May. '

    text: The seeds of the Silver Birch are tiny and are released by the female catkins
      in the autumn. Did you know, it is sometimes easy to confuse a Silver Birch
      with a Downy Birch? You can tell them apart by their shoots. New shoots on
      a Silver Birch are hairless and warty. Instead, the shoots on the Downy Birch
      are smooth and covered in soft hairs!
