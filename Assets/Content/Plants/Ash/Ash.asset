    text: 'Ash trees tend to grow together in clumps. If you find one, have a look
      at its neighbour too! Did you know you can recognise an Ash tree by looking
      at its buds? They are black and velvety, and are arranged opposite each other

    text: "Ash trees are deciduous, but did you know their leaves fall when they
      are still green? In late summer or early autumn, you will be able to find distinctive
      winged fruits called \u201Ckeys\u201D. These will fall from the tree in the
      winter or early spring. "

    text: The leaves on an Ash tree will move in the direction of the Sun, but it
      may surprise you to learn that the whole tree may lean! Have a look on a sunny
      day and see if you can spot this!
