    text: "The Horse Chestnut tree has compound leaves \u2013 meaning that each leaf
      is made up of smaller leaflets. These are arranged like fingers on a hand (palmate)
      \u2013 all radiating out from a single point. There are between 5-7 leaflets
      on each leaf, and each one is pointed with toothed (serrated) edges."

      conkers? Get a grown up to help you thread it on some string. "
