    text: "English Oak trees grow to be approximately 20-40m tall. They are easily
      recognised by their Acorns, which can be found from late September to early
      November. When ripe, the Acorns turn brown and fall from their cupules, when
      they are often then found by squirrels as a tasty snack for the winter! Oak
      trees don't start producing Acorns until they are 40 years old. \r\n \r\nIf
      you are trying to identify an Oak tree in the late winter, did you know you
      can look at its buds? They are found in clusters on the stem and are rounded
      with more than 3 scales. "
