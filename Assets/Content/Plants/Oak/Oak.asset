  description: "The English Oak, also known as the Common Oak, is a deciduous tree
    which is common in southern and central Britain. It has a broad and spreading
    crown with sturdy branches and can live up to 1000 years old!\r\n\r\nStage 1\r\nOak
    leaves have 4-5 rounded lobes and smooth edges.\r\n \r\nStage 2\r\nOak trees
    produce acorns. These are a type of nut that can grow into new Oak trees. Acorns
    are about 2.5 cm long and sit ina highly textured cup, called a cupule. \r\n
    \r\nStage 3\r\nOak leaves are arproximately 10 cm long and grow in bunches. You
    can identify an English Oak by looking at the leaf and acorn stems - the leaves
    have short stems, whereas the acorns have long stems!\r\n \r\nStage 4\r\nThe
    flowers on an English Oak are called catkins. These are yellow and about 6 cm
    long. The flowers on the catkin are more spreadout than those on other catkins,
    like those on a Silver Birch. You will tend to find them in April and May. \r\n
    \r\nStage 5\r\nEnglish Oak trees grow to be approximately 20-40m tall. They are
    easily recognised by their Acorns, which can be found from late September to
    early November. When ripe, the Acorns turn brown and fall from their cupules,
    when they are often then found by squirrels as a tasty snack for the winter!
    Oak trees don't start producing Acorns until they are 40 years old. \r\n \r\nIf
    you are trying to identify an Oak tree in the late winter, did you know you can
    look at its buds? They are found in clusters on the stem and are rounded with
    more than 3 scales. \r"
