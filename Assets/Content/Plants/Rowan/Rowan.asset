  description: 'A tree with a rich history, the elegant Rowan has juicy berries which
    makes it a favourite with birds and wildlife. Sometimes called the mountain ash,
    due to the similarity with Ash tree leaves, the Rowan is actually a member of
    the Rose family. Only growing to 15 meters, it is much smaller than Ash and can
    be found in towns and woods, more commonly in Scotland and the north of England.  '

    text: 'Rowan leaves are pinnately compound, which means they are made up smaller
      leaflets arranged like a feather. Each leaf has 11-15 smaller leaflets that
      grow in pairs, with one terminal leaf at the end. Leaflets are long, oval and
      have serrated edges. '

    text: 'Look really closely, and you will notice that the pairs of Rowan leaflets
      are placed alternately and not directly opposite to each other. This is a good
      way to tell their leaves apart from Ash tree leaves. Each leaflet is 3-6 cm
      long. '

    text: "In the late summer and early autumn, you will find bright red berries
      on the Rowan that are about 1 cm across. Have a closer look \u2013 each fruit
      has a tiny \u201Cstar\u201D in the middle! They are a great food source for
      birds and wildlife. "

    text: 'Rowan flowers grow in dense clusters and have five creamy white petals.
      If you can without damaging them, have a sniff. They are heavily scented! Each
      pollinated flower will develop into a berry so do not pick them. '

    text: 'The bark of the Rowan is smooth and silvery grey. In autumn, the Rowans
      leaves will turn a beautiful orange-red colour and fall off. Watch out for
      the new bud growth. These are purple and hairy and can help you identify the
      tree in early spring. '
